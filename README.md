This project introduces an involuntary attendance marking system, devoid of any kind of interference with the normal teaching procedure.The system can also be implemented during exam sessions or in other teaching activities where attendance is highly essential.This system eliminates classical student identification such as calling name of the student, or cheking respective identification cards of the student, which can not only interfere with the ongoing teaching process,but also can be stressful for students during examination sessions.In addition,the student have to register in the database to be recognised.The enrolment can be done on the spot through the user friendly interface.
